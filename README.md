# dellimeals

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This Flutter project is about a recipe of meals. In this app you can have different type of food menu options.
Also you can flitter your choices and mark them as favorite.

This is my first Flutter app and I have created while learning on Udemy course by Max.
